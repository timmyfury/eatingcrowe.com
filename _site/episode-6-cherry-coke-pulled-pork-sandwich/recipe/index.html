<h1>Recipe: Cherry Coke Pulled Pork</h1>

<p>These Cherry Coke Pulled Pork Sandwiches are crazy good. I think this is one of my best creations to date. The spiciness of the pork, with the sweetness of the Cherry Coke based barbecue sauce and the creamy goodness and crunch of the cole slaw makes an amazing combination.</p>

    - title: Recipe for Chianti Braised Short Ribs
      hardware:
          - large dutch oven
          - tongs
          - any oven safe cooking vessel
          - strainer
          - small sauce pan
      software:
          - short ribs
          - kosher salt
          - ground pepper
          - onion
          - parsnips
          - garlic cloves
          - tomato paste
          - olive oil
          - bottle of chianti
          - can of diced tomatoes
          - beef broth
          - thyme sprigs
          - bay leaf
          - butter
      procedure:
          - Preheat the oven to 300° and place the dutch oven onto the stove to begin warming it up so that you can sear the short ribs before the braising process begins.
          - Prep the aromatics. These will not be served with the dish, therefore they don't need to be cut in any fancy way. Dice 1 onion. Peel and dice 2 parsnips. Peel and dice about 5 or 6 garlic cloves.
          - We used a concentrated tomato paste, so take about a tablespoon on the paste and <strong>pince</strong> it. To do so, add a little water and mix it, just to make it into the consistency of ketchup.
          - Salt and pepper the short ribs to help bring out their flavor.
          - Now that the pan is hot, lightly coat it with olive oil and begin to sear all the sides of the short ribs and then set them aside.
          - Once the short ribs have all been seared, in the same pot, lightly saute the aromatics.
          - Add the pinced tomato paste, the ENTIRE bottle of chianti and allow this to boil so that some of the alcohol cooks off.
          - Add the can of diced tomatoes, then begin to add your short ribs to the pot.
          - Once you have all of the short ribs in, you want to add just enough beef broth to cover the top short ribs.
          - Add a few thyme sprigs and a bay leaf and bring everything to a boil.
          - Cover the pot and place it into the oven and allow it to cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. This allows the meat to get very tender and really moist.
          - <strong>This sauce was not done in the video, but is awesome, delicious and important!</strong> When they are finished cooking, remove the ribs from the Dutch oven. Place them in another cooking vessel and put them in a 170° oven to keep them warm.
          - Strain the braising liquid into a small sauce pan.
          - Simmer the braising liquid over a low flame to reduce until the braising liquid is a thick sauce.
          - Add a bit of butter to mellow the flavors and salt to taste.
          - When you plate the ribs, brush the ribs with this sauce.


    - title: Recipe for Parsnip Puree
      notes: I've broken down the dish into the braising of the short ribs and the recipe for the potato parsnip puree to accompany it. The braising takes a few hours, so you will have tons of time to prepare the side item while you wait.
      hardware:
          - large pot
          - strainer
          - hand masher
      software:
          - potatoes
          - parsnips
          - heavy cream
          - a stick of butter
      procedure:
          - Take equal parts potatoes and parsnips, peel them and cut them into about 1 inch cubes.
          - Boil both the potatoes and the parsnips until they become a mash-able consistency. The parsnips are denser, so they will take a little longer to become soft.
          - Once they are cooked, you want to strain the potatoes and parsnips, then return them to the stove for a few minutes. This is to cook off any extra moisture.
          - Take the hand masher and begin to mash them together.
          - Add heavy cream to eye, to make them a little creamier than regular mashed potatoes.
          - Add an entire stick of butter and proceed to mash until it is a smooth consistency.
          - Salt to taste.

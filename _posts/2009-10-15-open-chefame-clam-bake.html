<p>We dumped 5 tons of sand in the middle of the street behind <a href="http://www.pytphilly.com/">PYT</a> at the <a href="http://www.atthepiazza.com/">Piazza at Schmidts</a>. 100 strong we ate clams, lobsters, mussels, crabs and the <a href="/recipes/jalapeno-cheddar-corn-bread-recipe/">greatest corn bread ever</a>!</p>

<p>A lot of work went into pulling this madness off and I have a lot of people to thank for making it happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tommy Up and the amazing staff of PYT for giving us their space for a day and lending a million helping hands.</li>
<li>The Piazza and Tower Properties for letting us take over for the night.</li>
<li>JP Boudwin, Zack Driver and Kevin Ludwig for cleaning up the sand when we were done</li>
<li>Michael Campagna of <a href="http://www.avarestaurant.com/">Ava</a> for making sure we got the goods to make the meal for the masses</li>
<li>Bart Mroz and Jesse Middleton of <a href="http://openchefame.com/">Open Chefame</a> for choosing me to film this live monstrosity of an episode (and footing the bill)</li>

<li>Brian McElaney for filling his nice clean car with  a half ton of live seafood and taking photos of the event.</li>
<li>Paul Ritchey and Joe Williams for filming and editing the episode</li>
<li>Leroy Conroy, Jesse MacPherson, Mike Matzik, Matt Phillips, Rebecka Weidman, and Leonard Wimbush: A kitchen dream team that I hope will make my future restaurant a success.</li>
<li>and especially Dan Platt, who helped me keep my sanity and helped pull the whole thing together</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.dessertsbymatthew.com">Matt Phillips</a> provided the baking chops for the Clam bake. This Jalape√±o-cheddar Corn Bread may have been my idea but the recipe was all his, <strong>and it was real damn good</strong>.</p>

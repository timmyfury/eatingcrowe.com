<p>In this episode of Eating Crowe we learn not only how to properly process a lobster and how to make fresh pasta but we also learn some of the pitfalls of making fresh pasta and how to deal with them. The filling for this lobster ravioli is really good, there are few flavor combinations as good as lobster, prosciutto, sage and goat cheese. Enjoy!</p>

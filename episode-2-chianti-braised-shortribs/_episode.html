<p>I've broken down the dish into the braising of the short ribs and the recipe for the potato parsnip puree to accompany it. The braising takes a few hours, so you will have tons of time to prepare the side item while you wait.</p>
<h2>Process for braising short ribs</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 300° and place the dutch oven onto the stove to begin warming it up so that you can sear the short ribs before the braising process begins.</li>

<li>Prep the aromatics. These will not be served with the dish, therefore they don't need to be cut in any fancy way. Dice 1 onion. Peel and dice 2 parsnips. Peel and dice about 5 or 6 garlic cloves.</li>
<li>We used a concentrated tomato paste, so take about a tablespoon on the paste and <strong>pince</strong> it. To do so, add a little water and mix it, just to make it into the consistency of ketchup.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper the short ribs to help bring out their flavor.</li>
<li>Now that the pan is hot, lightly coat it with olive oil and begin to sear all the sides of the short ribs and then set them aside.</li>
<li>Once the short ribs have all been seared, in the same pot, lightly saute the aromatics.</li>
<li>Add the pinced tomato paste, the ENTIRE bottle of chianti and allow this to boil so that some of the alcohol cooks off.</li>
<li>Add the can of diced tomatoes, then begin to add your short ribs to the pot.</li>

<li>Once you have all of the short ribs in, you want to add just enough beef broth to cover the top short ribs.</li>
<li>Add a few thyme sprigs and a bay leaf and bring everything to a boil.</li>
<li>Cover the pot and place it into the oven and allow it to cook for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. This allows the meat to get very tender and really moist.</li>
<h3>This sauce was not done in the video, but is awesome, delicious and important!</h3>
<li>When they are finished cooking, remove the ribs from the Dutch oven. Place them in another cooking vessel and put them in a 170° oven to keep them warm.</li>
<li>Strain the braising liquid into a small sauce pan.</li>
<li>Simmer the braising liquid over a low flame to reduce until the braising liquid is a thick sauce.</li>
<li>Add a bit of butter to mellow the flavors and salt to taste.</li>
<li>When you plate the ribs, brush the ribs with this sauce.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Process for the potato parsnip puree</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take equal parts potatoes and parsnips, peel them and cut them into about 1 inch cubes.</li>
<li>Boil both the potatoes and the parsnips until they become a mash-able consistency. The parsnips are denser, so they will take a little longer to become soft.</li>
<li>Once they are cooked, you want to strain the potatoes and parsnips, then return them to the stove for a few minutes. This is to cook off any extra moisture.</li>
<li>Take the hand masher and begin to mash them together.</li>
<li>Add heavy cream to eye, to make them a little creamier than regular mashed potatoes.</li>
<li>Add an entire stick of butter and proceed to mash until it is a smooth consistency.</li>
<li>Salt to taste.</li>

</ol>

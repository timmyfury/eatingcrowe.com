<p>In this episode of Eating Crowe we make duck confit salad with roasted figs, caramelized walnuts and blackberry-balsamic vinaigrette. Hope you love my really rough first try at an introduction.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ryan and Katie for letting us invade their apartment and use their awesome kitchen. Also Chap, Maura and Jen for joining us for vittles. Thanks Joe at <a href="http://www.playskullentertainment.com/">Playskull</a>for letting me use his magical music on the cheap. Last, thanks to Paul Ritchey for hours of his time editing, rendering and most painful of all, watching me over and over again.</p>

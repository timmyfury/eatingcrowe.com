<p>If you are coming from the <a href="http://www.dailycandy.com/philadelphia/article/69340/Chefs+Table">Daily Candy</a>, welcome! Watch a <a href="/category/episodes/">few episodes</a> and enjoy! It was a pleasant surprise to be mentioned in this morning&#8217;s update. I&#8217;m very excited.</p>

<p>Some of you may know already but I will be cooking at the next <a href="http://openchefame.com/">Open Chefame</a> night at <a href="http://avarestaurant.com">Ava</a> alongside <a href="http://www.soliloquiescence.com/">Sara Feidt</a>. The night is already sold out and its still a week and a half away. Check out that Open Chefame site for more information and <a href="http://openchefame.com/2009/07/17/meet-tim-crowe-it-meets-food-and-fun/">read the profile of me</a> there. It was so nice of them to choose such a remarkably delightful picture of me.</p>

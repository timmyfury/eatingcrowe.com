<p>I was so excited about this that I forgot to post it anywhere! Last week, <a href="http://benkessler.com/">Ben Kessler</a> of <a href="http://unbreaded.com/2009/08/06/eating-crowe-cherry-coke-pulled-pork-sandwiches/">Unbreaded featured our Cherry Coke Pulled Pork Sandwich</a> Episode! I&#8217;m pretty excited about it. Unbreaded is one of my favorite food blogs. I also loved one of the comments on the story, Larry said, &#8220;Pretty good show but that beard scares me.&#8221; Right on Larry. Wait until you see Josh and me together in the next episode. We may have to rename the show &#8220;Back Woods Cookin&#8217; with Scruffs and Billy&#8221;.</p>

<p>Thanks Ben for the props!</p>
